## Future Improvements

Below are the tasks planned for future development:

### 1. User Authentication and Authorization

Implement user authentication to identify users and authorization to manage access control for different operations such as updating or deleting a comment.

### 2. Nested Comments

Allow comments to have nested replies, creating a threaded comment structure.

### 3. File Uploads

Enable users to upload voice memos or images with their comments, expanding the ways users can express themselves.

### 4. Performance Optimization

Review and optimize database queries and indexes to ensure the application can scale and perform well with a growing number of comments and users.

### 5. Automated Testing

Develop a suite of automated tests for the API endpoints to ensure reliability and to facilitate continuous integration and deployment workflows.

### 6. Frontend Development

Create a front-end interface that interacts with the backend, providing users with a seamless experience for posting and managing comments.
